1 We are using NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) which is one of the powerful NLP library.
2 Here we are using a pre-trained model which is trained using huge amount of datasets
3 We provide the content of the mail as an input to this model for prediction
4 Load the model
5 Input data will undergo the following pre-processing steps(Feature Engineering)
    5.1 Punctuations removal
    5.2 Lemmatization:Process converting a word into root word
    5.3 Stop word removal(is,was,are....)
    5.4 Data will be vectorized and saved (tf-idf:used for evaluating how important a word in a document)
6 This vector is used for prediction
